1- Install all packages using node package manger 
   $ npm i

2 - Before starting you have to fill the environment variable in the .env file which located in the root directory

3 - create the identity database (sequelize) (I'm using mssql)
   $ npx sequelize-cli db:create --config=config/identity-config.js

4 - migrate identity tables tables
   $ npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --config=config/identity-config.js

5 - seed the identity initial data (Roles & Permissions) (sequelize)
   $ npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all --seeders-path seeders/sequelizeIdentity --config=config/identity-config.js
